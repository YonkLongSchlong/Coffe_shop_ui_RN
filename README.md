# React Native Coffe Shop UI

This project is a React Native UI created with Expo.


I would recommend to run this project using the Expo Go app to prevent frame drop as much as possible for a better experience with [Reanimated v3](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started/) library.

## To run

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```



## Main libray used

- [Expo router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/): For file-based routing
- Some screen juggling between [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/) and ScaledSheet from [RN_size_matter](https://github.com/nirsky/react-native-size-matters) library for a responsive layout on different platform
